# How Good Are LLMs at Solving Brainteasers?

I was surprised to hear from a few friends that some tech companies still include puzzles in their interview process—or even dedicate a full 45-minute session—asking candidates to solve problems like this:

```
Two people had to go to the top of the hill. There's only one motorcycle, yet only one person can ride it. Fortunately, they both get to the top of the hill. How?
```

Let’s set aside why some companies might revisit riddles for candidate assessments today. 
Instead, let’s focus on the fun part: How do cutting-edge AI models perform on brainteaser questions that demand not only strong reasoning skills but also a touch of creative thinking?

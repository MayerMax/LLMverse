# LLMverse
**LLMverse**: A universe dedicated to projects using large language models.

Structure:
1.  Every project has its entry point under the `projects/` folder.
2.  Every project is supported with its own README file which provides relevant information
3.  Every project comes with its own `requriments.txt`, which can be installed in the `virtual environment` on the local machine to achieve full reproducibility of the results.
 
Table with the projects:

| Project  | Short description | Entry Point Link | Supporting material

|  How Good Are LLMs at Solving Brainteasers? |  How do cutting-edge AI models perform on brainteaser questions that demand not only strong reasoning skills but also a touch of creative thinking? In this small study, I evaluate the lateral thinking abilities of frontier OpenAI models, such as GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini on the dataset with riddles. While the model demonstrated solid performance overall, achieving 84% accuracy, its performance dropped significantly—to 65%—on puzzles that are unlikely to be publicly available on the internet and, therefore, were probably not part of the model’s training data.  | [link](https://github.com/MayerMax/LLMverse/blob/master/src/LLMVerse/projects/brainteasers_reasoning/openai_4o_model_performance.ipynb) to Notebook with reproducible code | [link]() to article
